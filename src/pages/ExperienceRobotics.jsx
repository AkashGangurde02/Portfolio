                                My time as a Software Team Member at the VIIT Robotics Club was driven entirely by curiosity and a deep passion for robotics. Working alongside technically skilled teammates, I was immersed in robotics and software-focused projects where logic, experimentation, and real-world problem solving were central to everything we built.
                            </p>
                            <p className="content-text">
                                This hands-on environment helped me understand how software interacts with hardware, how systems behave under real constraints, and how teamwork plays a crucial role in building reliable robotic solutions. The experience challenged me to think critically, adapt quickly, and stay committed through constant testing, iteration, and learning.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div className="content-block highlight">
                            <h2 className="content-title">ABU Asia-Pacific Robocon</h2>
                            <p className="content-text">
                                One of the most defining chapters of this journey was representing the team at <strong>ABU Asia-Pacific Robocon</strong>, a global robotics competition that pushed both technical ability and teamwork to their limits. I played a crucial role in programming the manual robot (R1), taking complete ownership of its software behavior — from movement logic to real-time control during competition tasks.
                            </p>
                            <p className="content-text">
                                This involved ensuring the robot could reliably survey the rice field, transplant seedlings, and throw sacks under high-pressure conditions. Working at this level demanded precision, fast debugging, and a deep understanding of how sensors, actuators, and control systems function together.
                            </p>
                            <p className="content-text">
                                Beyond the technical challenge, the Robocon journey became deeply personal. Countless hours of building, testing, failing, and improving together transformed the team into more than collaborators — it felt like a second family. The trust placed in me to handle such a critical system strengthened my confidence and sense of responsibility, making this experience one of the most meaningful chapters of my journey in robotics.
